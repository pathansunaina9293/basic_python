1. Guessing random number
import random
random_number = random.randint(1, 20)
guess_count = 1
print("Welcome to Number Guessing Game!")
print("A randon number between 1 and 20 has been selected, you have 5 tries to guess")
while guess_count <= 5:
    guess = int(input("Guess Number : "))
    if guess < 1 or guess > 20:
        print("Please enter a number between 1 and 20.")
    elif guess < random_number:
        print("Too Low")
    elif guess > random_number:
        print("Too High")
    else:
        print("Correct! You guessed the number!")
        break
    guess_count += 1
if guess_count > 5:
    print(f"Sorry, you've used all your guesses. The correct number was {random_number}.")



2. Prime number range
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
start = int(input("Enter start number: "))
end = int(input("Enter end number: "))
for number in range(start, end + 1):
    if is_prime(number):
        print(number)


3. single sum
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
while number >= 10:
    sum_digits = 0
    while number > 0:
        sum_digits += number % 10
        number //= 10
    number = sum_digits
print("Sum of single digits is:", number)
